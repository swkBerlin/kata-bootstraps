## Requirements

In order to work with Elixir, you have to first install it.  ƪ(ˆ▽ˆ)ʃ

Please remember that while Elixir is a rather small download (couple of Megabytes), the required Erlang/OTP is a bit larger (somewhere around 120 MB) so it makes sense to do the download before showing up to a Meetup.

## Roll your own

Installing Elixir will also provide you with the awesome task runner 'mix'. So in case you would rather start your own project, just do this:

    mix new <name>

One advantage would be that you can choose a more appropriate project name in this case.

## Tests

In order to run your tests, use this:

    mix test

Mix has a lot more to offer, thy this if you want to learn more:

    mix help

Welcome to the friendly world of Elixir! (♥͡_♥͡)
