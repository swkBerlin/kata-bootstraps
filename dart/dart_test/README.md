# Dart Test boilerplate

This boilerplate uses

- [Dart 2.19.6+](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Test](https://pub.dev/packages/test)

Test files should be picked based on their name, here's a few examples that will get picked up by Test:

- `test/kata_test.dart`
- `test/my_test_file_test.dart`

## Installing dependencies

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Run tests once
dart test

# Run tests for a specific file
dart test test/kata_test.dart
```
