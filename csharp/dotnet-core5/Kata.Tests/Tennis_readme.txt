About this Kata
This Kata is about implementing a simple tennis game and display the score.
There is a scoreboard that you can access via it's interface an update the displayed score
for the crowd to see.

The scoring system is rather simple:

Each player can have either of these points in one game “love” “15” “30” “40”
If you have 40 and you win the point you win the game, however there are special rules.
If both have 40 the players are “deuce”.
If the game is in deuce, the winner of a point will have advantage
If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
Alternate description of the rules per Wikipedia 
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#Scoring ):

A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total 
and at least two points more than the opponent.

The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: 
scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “15”, “30”, and 
“40” respectively.

If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are 
equal, the score is “deuce”.

If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one 
more point than his opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the 
player in the lead.

I will win everytime. I want to conquer the world....
